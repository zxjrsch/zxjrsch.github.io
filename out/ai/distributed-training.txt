5:T524,Neural network weights is the fist pieces of data that needs to be stored for the duration of training, it is used during forward pass to compute activation, and it is used during backwards to compute activation gradients. The second piece of data which require storage are the activation of each layers, since these are used to compute the weight gradient of weights in the layer to which the activations are the inputs during forward pass, as we have already seen. Activation can be released whenever the weight gradients they are associated with are computed. The third piece of data that is stored are activation gradients. They are used to compute gradients during backpropagation through the next layer (or operation), and can be released after computing activation and weight gradients in the next layer (or operation). The fourth piece of data are weight gradients, with a lifetime from produced until the corresponding weights are updated. The fifth type of data are associated with the optimization algorithm which updates the weight using the gradients. In default optimizers that implements the Adam algorithm, we need to keep track of the exponential moving average of the weight and the square of each weight. These moving averages are ususally called optimizer states, and persist throughout training.0:{"P":null,"b":"C9ZA5QLb86CfEdUgr5wD1","c":["","ai","distributed-training"],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["ai",{"children":["distributed-training",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/1fcb9d377ba4db76.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/4057cc9dbcc744c0.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"geist_a71539c9-module__T19VSG__variable geist_mono_8d43a2aa-module__8Li5zG__variable antialiased","children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col justify-center min-h-screen","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row justify-center pt-15","children":["$","$L4",null,{}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grow flex justify-center w-full pt-10 md:pt-15 px-3","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col w-full max-w-full md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-3xl","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold flex justify-center","children":"6D Parallelism for Distributed Training"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm flex justify-center pt-5","children":null}],["$","div",null,{"className":"","children":[["$","div","0",{"children":["$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"indent-10 md:mt-10 grow text-lg font-medium text-base text-justify","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"indent-10 md:mt-5 grow text-lg font-medium text-base text-justify","children":"Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operator in neural networks, and in the above we have fully elucidated the differentiation of the loss through such an operator in full generality, and we have applied this to the attention operator, a compound operator consisting of a series of matrix mulitiplications.
